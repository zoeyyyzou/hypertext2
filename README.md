The data in *Yelp reviews* dataset is stored in JSON and SQL formats. Taking JSON format as an example, each review contains the following contents:

```json
{
  // string, 22 character unique review id
  "review_id": "KU_O5udG6zpxOg-VcAEodg",
  
  // string, 22 character unique user id, maps to the user in user.json
  "user_id": "mh_-eMZ6K5RLWhZyISBhwA",
  
  // string, 22 character business id, maps to business in business.json
  "business_id": "XQfwVwDr-v0ZS3_CbbE5Xw",
  
  // integer, star rating
  "stars": 3.0,
  
  // integer, number of useful votes received
  "useful": 0,
  
  // integer, number of funny votes received
  "funny": 0,
  
  // integer, number of cool votes received
  "cool": 0,
  
  // string, the review itself
  "text": "If you decide to eat here, just be aware it is going to take about 2 hours from beginning to end. We have tried it multiple times, because I want to like it! I have been to it\u0027s other locations in NJ and never had a bad experience. \n\nThe food is good, but it takes a very long time to come out. The waitstaff is very young, but usually pleasant. We have just had too many experiences where we spent way too long waiting. We usually opt for another diner or restaurant on the weekends, in order to be done quicker.",
  
  // string, date formatted YYYY-MM-DD
  "date": "2018-07-07 22:09:11"
}
```

Because the *yelp reviews* dataset is relatively large and there is no direct link to download, this paper first downloads the JSON format dataset from [Yelp Dataset | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset) and divides it into ten small files, each containing 100000 comments. The sorted dataset is uploaded to GitHub, which can be obtained from here => [zoeyyyzou/yelp (github.com)](https://github.com/zoeyyyzou/yelp)
